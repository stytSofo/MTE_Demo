This repositry is part of my Master Thesis project on Compartmentalization with MTE.

In this repository I created a native app that performs benchmarks on real hardware that support MTE to collect data regarding the performance overhead from using MTE. 
This repository also contains the code of a toy example of how MTE can be used as a compartmentalization mechanism
